Question-It seems that another encrypted message has been intercepted. The encryptor seems to have learned their lesson though and now there isn't any punctuation! Can you still crack the cipher?
Download the message here.

steps-
1. First we download the file with the given link and then we open the file to display its contents revealing continuous string of chracters without punctuations.

2. We know that the key is encrypted using substitution cipher wherin all 26 alphabets are replaced by another set which is basically one of the 26! permutations possible.

3. To decrypt the message , we use planetcalc.com which tries all permutations and gives us the key used to decrypt along with the passcode.Refer to the respective screenshot for more reference.
