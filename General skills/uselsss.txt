QUESTION-There's an interesting script in the user's home directory
The work computer is running SSH. We've been given a script which performs some basic calculations, explore the script and find a flag.
Hostname: saturn.picoctf.net
Port:     49545
Username: picoplayer
Password: password

1. Firstly we connect to the host using SSH by using the command ssh picoplayer@saturn.picoctf.net -p 49545 and enter the password

2. we do ls in the pwd to list all the files present in the given directory.It lists 'useless' as a file 

3.When we do 'cat useless' we get a script which actually just carries out simple mathematical operations. In the else part there is an echo"read manual" and hence we do man useless to go to manual

4.At the end of manual we get our key.
