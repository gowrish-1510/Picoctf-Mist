QUESTION-Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too. Here's a dictionary with all possible passwords based on the password conventions we've seen so far

1.First we download all the files and save them in the same directory.

2.We open the dictionary.txt file in the python file using open function(open(dictionary.txt)) and it contains all the possible passwords for the flag.

3. We iterate through all elements in the dictionary and compare it with the original password . While comparing, we ensure there is no whitespace in dictionary elements using the split() function in python.

4.In one iteration, we get the password as 7e5f which gives us our picoctf key

password- picoCTF{h45h_sl1ng1ng_40f26f81}
